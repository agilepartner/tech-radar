# Create a new card
![Create a new card](images/create-a-new-card.png)  

## What ?
Because each context is different we didn't necessarily get to put everything on our cards.
You may feel that something that we have not covered is important in your context, or maybe you want to share something you like.

In this challenge you have to create a new card.

## Why ?
Share and communicate about your topics of interest inside your company is really important and symbolizes the importance you bring to your job.

## How ?
- Brainstorm in order to find topics that are not covered by our cards
- Use one of our template (in the resources below)
- Share your card (inside your company, on twitter, ...)
